nj_Chat
=======
<p>This is a nodejs chat application. Just doing some learning using it. If you want to implement a simple chat or a socket based connection between the client and the server you can refer to the latter half of server.js for the server side code and chat.js for the client side code.</p> 
 
<p> Not hosted anywhere as of now due to lack of hosting options and a dash of laziness.</p>

<h4>Instructions for local running</h4>
<p>You'll need to get socket.io to run this application. Just hit npm install socket.io in the directory where you have this application and npm will install it for you.</p>
