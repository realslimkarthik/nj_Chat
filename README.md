nj_Chat
=======
<p>This is a nodejs chat application. Just doing some learning using it.</p> 
 
<p> Not hosted anywhere as of now due to lack of hosting options and a sliver of laziness.</p>

<h4>Instructions for local running</h4>
<p>You'll need to get socket.io, express and node-mysql to run this application. npm install <<package-name>> will do the trick. Only recently moved to Expressjs.</p>
